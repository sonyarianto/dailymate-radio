# Dailymate Radio

I fork this from SomaFM Music Player Web-App at https://github.com/rainner/soma-fm-player by [Rainner Lins][site]

### Why I fork this
- Learn new things (Audio API, AudioContext API, little bit Vue.js)
- I like the interface (PC + Mobile)
- I will add more functionality, not only for SomaFM player but other streaming service as well

### How to run
- Clone it to your local machine
- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm run dev` and it will open port http://localhost:8000

### How to build to production
- Run `npm run build`
